# Hotel-Landing--Page
This is a imaginary landing page of a Hotel with some cool animation completely made with HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JS. This doesn't use any third party css or js library for animation. The UI is mostly compatible with desktop.

This website is image heavy and doesn't load very fast. Please refresh after it loads fully to experience more beautifully.

## Edit
The 'background-attachment: fixed' css styling, which is used in the page has some issues with mobile browsers. So the page doesn't show up properly in mobile phones.
